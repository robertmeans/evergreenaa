			<h1>Total Interactions</h1>

      <p>This is the most basic, raw, cleanest and best information here.</p>

			<p>It means that from the <span id="msg-uni-ip"></span> unique IP's there were <span id="msg-tot-in"></span> interactions. These interactions only include opening individual meetings (for now). In other words, someone had to specifically click on a meeting in order to register in this count.</p>

      <h1>Individual Interactions</h1>

      <p>The sum of these numbers (<span id="msgb-tot-in-int"></span>) is larger than the "<span id="msgb-tot-in"></span> Interactions" at the top because it includes clicking on days in addition to meetings.</p>

      <h1>Unique IP</h1>

      <p>This one's tricky for the moment because, since this whole thing started mid-stream, there were people already logged in and so it only shows their IP one time but they may have done something like opened a day which is an action worth keeping. I put this message here so I can use it if I want once I get this thing working correct.</p>
