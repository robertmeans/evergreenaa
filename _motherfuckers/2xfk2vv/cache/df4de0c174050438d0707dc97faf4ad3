Nucleotide excision repair is a more versatile excision repair mechanism: unlike base excision repair and direct reversal, which require specific enzymes for different types of damage, nucleotide excision repair senses distortion of the overall structure of the DNA double helix, and is therefore more general for different types of DNA damage. 0000165630 00000 n However, robust DNA repair and damage-bypass mechanisms faithfully protect the DNA by either removing or tolerating the damage to ensure an overall survival. • Thousands of random changes occur everyday. DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome. DNA replication inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea, inhibit DNA replication by affecting deoxynucleotide pools, causing stress at stalled replication forks, which induces DNA damage. Front Microbiol. 7.
